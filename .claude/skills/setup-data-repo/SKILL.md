name: setup-data-repo
description: Create the user's private data repo for job triage — the separate git repository that holds their criteria.md, the saved LinkedIn search, the ledger of judged jobs and the triage reports — and point this code repo at it. Use on a fresh clone, when any script reports "No data repo found", or when the user says "set me up", "create my data repo", "I just cloned job-triage".

# Set up the data repo

This repo is code and generic knowledge; it holds nothing about any one person.
Everything personal — `criteria.md`, `linkedin/filters.json`,
`linkedin/ledger.json`, `linkedin/session.json`, `triage/` — lives in a
**private data repo** next to it. This skill creates that repo so the triage
skills have somewhere to read and write. Do it once per user; it is safe to
re-run, because it refuses to overwrite.

## 1. Check what exists

```sh
python3 -c 'import sys; sys.path.insert(0, ".claude/skills/job-triage"); import data_dir; print(data_dir.find_data_dir())'
```

- A path that already has a `criteria.md` → set up. Say so, show the path, and
  offer to review `criteria.md` with the user. Stop.
- `None` → continue.

## 2. Ask three things, in one message

1. **Where should it live?** Default `../job-triage-data`, a sibling of this repo
   named after it, found with no configuration. Anywhere outside this repo works;
   the script then records the path in `.data-dir`.
2. **Should it have a remote?** Only ever a **private** one, and only if they want
   off-machine backup. Never create or add a public remote: the repo will hold a
   salary floor, company decisions and a record of every job they rejected.
   Creating any remote is the user's call — ask, and do nothing if they do not
   say yes.
3. **Will they use LinkedIn?** Reading LinkedIn needs no account. Saving and
   dismissing jobs there needs their cookies in `linkedin/session.json`, and
   automating a logged-in session can get an account restricted. Default is no.

## 3. Create it

```sh
python3 .claude/skills/job-triage/init_data_repo.py [--dir=<path>]
```

It copies `templates/data-repo/` (a blank `criteria.md`, `linkedin/filters.json`,
an empty `linkedin/ledger.json`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.gitignore`, an empty
`triage/`), runs `git init` with one commit, and writes `.data-dir` when the
location is not the default. It refuses a directory inside this repo and one that
already has a `criteria.md`.

If they asked for a remote: `gh repo create <name> --private --source=<dir> --push`
— after confirming the exact name and that it is private.

## 4. Fill `criteria.md`

A blank file makes every verdict a guess. Walk the user through it section by
section, asking for real decisions rather than abstractions: ask which of the
last postings they rejected and why, which they would have taken, and what the
floor is.

1. The candidate in one line.
2. Stack: disqualifying, explicitly fine, where "X or Y" stops.
3. Role type: what they want, what they never want.
4. Location: remote, hybrid and on-site, with the places each one allows.
5. Salary: the floor, the target, how rates are compared.
6. Companies: permanent bans and temporary holds.
7. Seniority: the target and what lower levels are acceptable.
8. Language.

Write only what they said. An unknown stays a `<…>` placeholder and the first
run will surface it as `UNDECIDED` with a question. Commit in the data repo:
`git -C <dir> add -A && git -C <dir> commit -m "feat(criteria): initial rules"`.

## 5. Fill the LinkedIn search

LinkedIn has no saved search, so `linkedin/filters.json` is it. Generate it from
the onetap saved search instead of typing it:

1. Call `get_my_filters` and save the response to `/tmp/onetap-filters.json`.
2. Set `default_country` in `linkedin/filters.json` to the country their cities
   are in, because `sync-filters` appends it to a city that has no verified geoId.
3. Preview, then write:

```sh
python3 .claude/skills/job-triage/sources/linkedin.py sync-filters /tmp/onetap-filters.json --dry-run
python3 .claude/skills/job-triage/sources/linkedin.py sync-filters /tmp/onetap-filters.json
```

4. Show what a sweep would cost before anyone runs one:
   `python3 .claude/skills/job-triage/sources/linkedin.py search --dry-run`.

If they do not use onetap, fill `keywords` and `locations` by hand from the
template and the notes in `.claude/skills/job-triage/sources/LINKEDIN.md`.

## 6. Make the directory reachable by the agent

The data repo is outside this repo's working directory, so the agent may be asked
for permission on every read and write. Offer to add it once:

- Claude Code — `permissions.additionalDirectories` in `.claude/settings.local.json`
  (git-ignored by design; create it if absent), or `/add-dir <path>`.
- Codex — the path as a writable root in `.codex/config.toml`'s sandbox settings.

## 7. Verify

```sh
python3 .claude/skills/job-triage/sources/linkedin.py ledger   # {"total": 0, ...} is right for a new repo
python3 .claude/skills/job-triage/triage.py sources            # lists both sources
git -C <dir> remote -v                                         # empty, or a private remote you created
```

Tell the user where the data repo is, that it is private, and that the next step
is `/job-triage`.
